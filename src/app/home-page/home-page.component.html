      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Silent Voice Loud Hands, LLC is a Mississippi company and was established by Adrianna Chain in March
        2024 to educate and advocate for issues within the D/deaf, hard-of-hearing, Deaf/Blind communities. Our goal
        is to educate the general public of various issues D/deaf people face and how we can resolve them together. We
        also provide education to individuals in the deaf community to boost self-advocacy and independence.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        Silent Voice Loud Hands, LLC is here to help with minor issues such as advocating for in-person interpreters in
        medical facilities. We have pitched in the fight for in-person interpreters in the place of VRI (Video-Relay
        Interpreters) in medical facilities such as Baptist-Memorial Hospital in MS, TN, and AR. We can help with
        issues that can be resolved on the ground level by using resources from around the United States to advocate for
        a change. For example, we often use the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) resources to further assist on
        a legal aspect. We also often team up with other Mississippi organizations and deaf-led business to fight
        towards solutions on issues.
